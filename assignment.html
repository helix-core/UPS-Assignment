            The world has changed. Drastically infact, over the past few decades. 
            The change has been both a boon as well as a bane to humanity.
             But it's crazy how much we have transcended from a green clean 
             world to a dark polluted one. 
             So? What was it like before?

            This is what Earth looked like. Not many years ago, just a decade ago.
            Beautiful isn't it? Greener, cleaner and much more peaceful.
            Yes, we were less connected; Didn't have high speed internet or 5G networks.
            Reels and TikToks weren't a thing and people spent more time on the streets than
            their phones. But, change is necessary rite? And so we evolved...

            This our world today! Much much advanced with technology embracing every nook
            and cranny of the world. Internet and social media connects everyone and
            everything is known by everyone. Technological advancements are skyrocketing and 
            fields like IT, Healthcare, Education, Recreation, Social Media, Entertainment are all
            thriving. So much has improved and livelihood has improved drastically for humans
            as a whole but at what cost?

            Change is good and change is necessary. Technology is a double edged sword
            , which when used right can be beneficial to humanity. But how
            many of us use it responsibly? We have taken advantage of what's available to us
            and have started to eat away at Earth with cellphone towers, pollution, exploitation,
            hunting, and so on. <br>A small step can have a huge impact. Let's think of what could be improved and whether all
            this is worth the sacrifice. Think Responsibly, Act Responsibly.
